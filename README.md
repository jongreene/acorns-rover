# Semi-Autonomous Rover
> At the heart of this bluetooth enable rover is a Giant Gecko STK3700 development board. The board is currently driving four independently timed pwm motor-drivers, handling UART communications, and sampling external sensor data from custom PCBs. 

## Downloading and Compiling
...

### Cloning
> When cloning this repo...

### Building for the first time
#### Cmake build system and it's dependencies
> At runtime, the cmake build system will automatically download a local copy of ARM GNU toolchain as well as a Mbed OS. The toolchain will be configured to be used for compilation. The user-specified version of Mbed OS will be checked out. Once all of the resources have been downloaded, all relavent patches are applied to third-party resources are applied.


## Commands
> Through the use of a highly modularized C/C++ framework, defining new callable functions takes little to no understanding of the underlying services. New routines can be implemented in just a few steps, making driver development fast and simple. While this rover is very capable, the underlying framework that drives it is the true bread and butter of this project.
